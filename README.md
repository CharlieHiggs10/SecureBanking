Secure Banking System

The program allows users to create and manage multiple bank accounts, including checking and savings accounts, by inputting personal and account information such as names, addresses, account numbers, and PINs.

Users can perform various banking operations through a console-based interface, including adding new accounts, checking balances, depositing funds, and withdrawing funds, by entering their account number and PIN for authentication.

The program implements an encryption mechanism using a pseudo-random number generator seeded by the user's PIN to encrypt account details. This feature protects sensitive information if an incorrect PIN is entered.
